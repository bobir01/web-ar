# WebAR-ThreeJS

Augmented Reality has always been my favorite topic. 

With the prominent improvement on both hardware and software recently, I have witnessed so many marvelous creations. 

Now I dare to challenge myself to build my own AR project.

# How To Run

Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your system.

1. Clone this project
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the result

Note: For AR features to work properly, you'll need to access the application from a device with camera and motion sensors.

# Future Work

1. Translating/scaling my model when moving camera - for a better AR project, it is important to show how we interact with virtual model.
2. Handle abrupt displacement of models - I think it's because sensors data have noises.
3. Use a more stable data sources - Sensors data are not reliable and well-rounded if designing a more delicate AR project. I think I can use other data source like GPS to optimize this project.
